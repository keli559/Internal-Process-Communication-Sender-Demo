// this application is a Sender
// made to work with a Receiver that is already made in Pascal by xxxxxx 
// The Receiver is located at 
// "K:\xxxxxxxxxxx"
// 
// This application is meant to send string "Hello World" to the Receiver
// if successful, the Receiver would appear on screen:
//
//                 WM_CopyData from: 3819
//                 Received string "Hello World!" at 6/3/2015
//
// Application:
// 1. Put "Hello World!" message into a data structure called "COPYDATASTUCT"
// 2. Find receiver by its app title "ReceiverMainForm" and its Class "TReceiverMainForm" (debug window: a pop-up window should show up with non-zero integers)
// 3. Send message in COPYDATASTRUCT through WM_COPYDATA code to receiver
